            <p id="para">Extending over 870-square-kilometres of lush well-watered savannah east
                 of Mount Kenya, Meru National Park is transitional to the moist central highlands
                  and arid northern plains of Kenya. Wildlife, though plentiful, can be quite
                   elusive, and the park is most notable perhaps for its untrammelled wilderness
                    feel. Nevertheless, it is a good place to see localised large mammals associated
                     with the arid north, including the handsome reticulated giraffe, striking Beisa 
                     oryx, shy lesser kudu and stretch-necked gerenuk antelope. </p>

        <p class="more-story">Several of the camps here offer night drives, which <br>
             can be very good for close-up sightings of genet and bushbaby. A series <br>
              of 13 perennial streams rim through the park, emptying into the Tana River, <br>
               which is Kenya's largest waterway and forms the parkâ€™s southern boundary.  <br>
               Lined with riverine forest and tall doum palms, these waterways support <br>
               several hippo pools along with abundant birds on the open plains.</p>
